{\huge{\textbf{Introduction}}}
\vskip12pt

Hi, reader! My name is Mikhail Stolpovskiy, and I am a PhD in physics. During my scientific career, I worked in the fields of particle physics, cosmology, and astrophysics. And during the last  years, I also engaged myself as a science populariser, writing articles for the web journals. In addition, I am slightly talented in drawing. So I decided to fuse  my diverse competencies and create this deck of playing cards, where I dedicate each of the suits to one of the four major fields of research in modern physics: quantum mechanics, particle physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.

Why cards? That was an idea that came to me at one conference some years ago. All the days were tightly packed with the reports about the frontiers of  modern physics, and in the evenings we amused ourselves with playing card games. No surprise that on the last day of the conference these two have merged into something funny and, I hope, useful.

I study physics for 16 years, and I learned very well the first commandment of learning: practice makes perfect. And it is especially important for such a challenging field as physics. When you play with my cards, you effectively recall all these subjects. And it creates an overall vision of modern physics in your head. When I was a student at the University, I have to admit I was a lousy student. I was bored with physics because I didn't understand it. The crucial point is that I had not this vision of beautiful interconnection of all the different areas of this marvellous science. I didn't have a broad picture. Now I want to fix this for the future students, and to all people interested in physics.

On each page of this book, you will find a short explanation of a card. I tried to design it in such a way that the low-value cards are the most basic notions, the jacks, queens and kings are the scientists that created the foundation of this science, and the aces summarize the most important ideas. The high-value cards, from 8's to 10's, describe the very edge of the current knowledge and prospects.

I start with the small scales of elementary particles to the large sizes, finishing with the whole Universe. In first glance, it looks very patchy. However, on every card, you will find a lot of links between the different parts of the book (I give them in the parentheses, like for example (2$\heartsuit$) is the link to the gauge theory). And the two jokers describe two competing theories of everything, which aim to give a single description to the whole physics.

I am particularly proud to have an opportunity to emphasize the role of women in physics with the queen cards. They represent four brilliant female scientists who made truly ground-breaking discoveries. I will be especially proud if some girl will choose the fundamental research as her future specialisation thanks to my cards. The historically set under-presence of women in science is a stopping factor, and who knows how much more we will discover if we accept the diversity!

With this deck, you can play all the usual card games. Or you can play unique physics games. Here are a couple of suggestions. The physics poker: instead of finding the combinations of values you search for the combinations of meanings. For example, Plank (K$\diamondsuit$) links to the cosmic microwave background (3$\spadesuit$). Looking at the anisotropies of the latter (6$\spadesuit$), we hope to study the inflation epoch (9$\spadesuit$). Who knows, maybe the inflation is explained by the Higgs field (A$\heartsuit$). Thus you get five interconnected cards, so it is a flush! After the usual turn of betting, when you open your cards, you have to justify that you got a flush because it is maybe not so visible to other players. So to win you need not only be good at poker but in physics too!

Another suggestion is the physics cheat game. Deal the cards between the players. On your turn, you put some number of cards on the table and say: I know all these cards. The next player can trust you or not. In the first case s/he can turn face up your cards, pick any of them and ask you about its meaning. If you answer correctly, your opponent takes all the cards on the table. Otherwise, it is you who grab them. However, if the other player trusts you, s/he can continue the turn by adding more cards on the pile saying that s/he knows all of them, and the next player in the circle will choose to trust this or not. The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards.

This book doesn't pretend to be a complete description of the discussed topics. It is instead a mere introduction. At the end of each suit, you'll find a list of suggested materials to dig down. That will give you a solid background in the subject. But I haven't seen so far anything that would aim to provide a global overview of the modern fundamental physics. That is the primary goal of this book and this deck. So use it as a map in your journey to the world of physics. And farewell!
